You can call me Sabik. I am an independent Machine Learning (ML) researcher mainly focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP). Currently, I am working as the head course instructor of Applied Data Science and Machine Learning at Amar iSchool, an online educational platform where we empower the ML enthusiasts with a limited background knowledge of Computer Science and Mathematics.</description>

      <description>My Experience with Omdena Inc.  Assalamualikum everyone, I have completed an 8-week NLP project with Omdena very recently. This post is intended to get folks to know about the platform and my experience throughout the journey. I am going to break down the post into 4 major parts giving answers to 4 frequently asked questions to anyone who worked with Omdena.
What is Omdena Inc.? Omdena is a bottom-up collaborative platform to build AI.</description>

      <description>Please read this before going through the projects.  I could not link the source code to some of the projects below due to client confidentiality or lab confidentiality. Everything related to a particular project is not described to the full extent here. I only discussed the motivation (why and how I or my team started working on this problem), problem statement (what the problem is/was in short), approach (not the formal version, just how I or my team approached the problem), results (final outcome) and my contribution (what exactly I did and learned new from this project).</description>
