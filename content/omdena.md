# My Experience with Omdena Inc. <br/>

Assalamualikum everyone,
I have completed an 8-week NLP project with Omdena very recently. This post is intended to get folks to know about the platform and my experience throughout the journey. I am going to break down the post into 4 major parts giving answers to 4 frequently asked questions to anyone who worked with Omdena.

### What is Omdena Inc.?

Omdena is a bottom-up collaborative platform to build AI. Let's break this sentence down into simpler words. Omdena is built on community. When the community gets strong, Omdena gets stronger as a whole and when Omdena gets stronger, it can provide better support to the collaborators. Omdena provides a platform where new startups or non-profit organizations in need of an AI solution can get that in 8-week time. In each project, there 50 collaborators (Data Analysts, ML Engineers, Data Scientists) from different countries all over the world. They grind on the problem for 8 weeks and finally give a collaborative solution. Till now, Omdena has completed 68 projects with 1800+ collaborators from 100 countries. They launch a new project every week. Anyone can look up the challenges on their website.

Recently Omdena launched 25+ local chapters. Here, collaborators from all around the world work on local challenges. These projects are open-source and launched in demand of that local region. Check out Omdena Bangladesh Chapter Here: https://omdena.com/chapters/bangladesh/

### How do things work in Omdena?

If you are interested to join Omdena's collaborator platform, you need to apply to a project on their website (https://omdena.com/projects/#our_challenges). They have a big queue of applicants waiting so you might need to wait for a long time. In my case, they connected with me 3-4 months later I applied. I even forgot that I applied there. Later I understood that they have a referral program where you need to apply with referral codes from previous collaborators. The application with referral codes gets priority and takes less time probably 2-3 weeks. I will share my referral code at the end of this post so that anyone interested in this group can join. 

After your application is reviewed and accepted by Omdena, you need to go through an interview round on Skype. This round is basically to validate what you wrote in the application and also if you can actually collaborate with 49 other members in the group. After the interview, they notify you if you are selected for a project. After that, you are requested to join a slack channel and great things start here. 

Another thing to mention here is that Omdena's policy with collaborators is called do-ocracy which means if you are inactive without any reason they will remove you from the project and you need to apply again to work in any future projects. However, they give an alert one week earlier so that you can start being active or they can check if you are really inactive. Nobody asks anyone to do anything. Activity is measured based on GitHub pull requests, participation in slack channels, participation in weekly meetings, and some other things with the clients. You can know more about the community tier here: https://omdena.com/community-tiers/

### What exactly did I do there?

Our client was Equilo( https://www.equilo.io/ ). <br/>
This is the project I worked on: https://omdena.com/projects/ai-gender-equality/ 

**Technologies used:**
- Web Scraping (more than 10 websites)
- Dataflow, Cloud SQL, GCS, App Engine, Firestore
- Django, React Js
- Natural Language Processing
- StreamLit

**Problem statement:** Build a system to understand gender inequality in organizations by analyzing company reviews and recommend actions to prevent them.<br/>

**My Experience:**
The first day I joined the slack channel, I was completely lost. However, as time passed, things started to get clear. To tackle the problem, tasks originate organically. For example, a task might handle web scraping, another task might handle deployment, and so on. The tasks are also originated by the collaborators so everything is self-supervised. In my project, there were 50 collaborators from 20 different countries. And at the end of the project, there were 7 tasks in total tackling the whole process. For each task, there should be a task leader from the collaborators who is responsible to see the end of that particular task. I was active throughout the challenge though it was a bit tough for me to manage time as I was already doing a full-time job at Pioneer Alpha, a part-time job at Amar iSchool, and also some independent research work. But somehow the Almighty gave me the strength to grind, thrive, and survive, and alhamdulillah I did survive. In these 7 tasks, I had major contributions in 4 of them. I was the task leader of 2 of these tasks. One of my task teams worked on building the recommender system for organizations with low gender equality scores. Another task team worked on building the web app and deploying the whole data and machine learning pipeline to Google Cloud Platform. As a task leader, I had to present the progress of that task every week in client meetings. 

The most important experience for me is that I made friends from different parts of the world. Now, I have friends from Calcutta, Chennai, Egypt, Australia, and so on. I was the only Bangladeshi in that project. Even though we spoke in English during all the meetings, I had a full-Bangla meeting with the Calcutta guys and a full-Hindi meeting with the Indian guys. I got to know that countries can be different but programmers are the same. They face the same struggles, rant about the same things, and when they unite with their wits and expertise they can face any sort of problems.

### Do I recommend others to work with Omdena?

If you can single out the spare time of 10-15 hours a week from your study or full-time job, I would recommend that you should apply and work on the projects and learn how to grind on problems as a community. This is a big learning opportunity for anyone. If you do not have that, then you should not apply since Omdena works on do-ocracy as I have said earlier.
