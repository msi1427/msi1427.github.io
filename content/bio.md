السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ (May peace be upon you) <br/> <br/>
I am Mohammad Sabik Irbaz, born and raised in Bangladesh, near the longest sea beach in the world, Cox's Bazar. You can call me **Sabik**. I am an independent Data Science and Machine Learning (ML) researcher primarily focused on **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Applications**. Currently, I am working as a **Data Scientist at [Leadbook Pte. Ltd.](https://www.leadbook.com/)**. I am also working with **Dr. Md. Ruhul Amin from Fordham University, NY, USA** on data-driven Social NLP problems. Prior to that, I used to work as a **Lead ML Engineer** at *[Omdena Inc.](https://omdena.com/)* and *[Pioneer Alpha Ltd](https://pioneeralpha.com/)*. I am also taking data science and ML courses in [MasterCourse](https://mastercourse.site/) where our goal is to bridge the gap between academia and industry and build the next generation of data scientists and ML engineers.<br/> <br/>
My current research interests revolve around a broad range of NLP and ML topics. I enjoy working with different NLP and Data Science topics like **Low-resource NLP**, **Commonsense Reasoning**, **Computational Social Science**, **Data-Centric AI**, and **Health and Behavioral Informatics**. However, I should concede that sometimes while solving a particular research problem, I explore different topics which are not directly aligned with my research interests. I find this sort of exploration a learning opportunity and also a way to bring in different perspectives to solve problems more efficiently. I got habituated to this sort of problem-solving approach during my 4 years of competitive programming career (2017-2020).<br/> <br/>
Other than AI and Data Science, I also like to explore History, Theology, Geopolitics, Psychology, Social Sciences, and various medicine and healthcare-related topics in my leisure. As I consider myself a lifelong student of scientific research and development, I put myself on a ceaseless journey to unravel the mysteries of this convoluted universe so that I can bring positive changes to the world. 

### Research Interests:
- NLP Applications (Low-resource NLP, Question Answering, Commonsense Reasoning, etc.)
- AI for Good (Social, Clinical \& Other Disciplines)
- Fact verification using historical data
- Data-centric AI
