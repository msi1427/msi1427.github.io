Assalamu Alaikum (May peace be upon you), <br/> <br/>
I am Mohammad Sabik Irbaz, born and raised in Bangladesh, near the longest sea-beach in the world, Cox's Bazar. You can call me **Sabik**. I am an independent Machine Learning (ML) researcher mainly focused on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. Currently, I am working as the head course instructor of **Applied Data Science and Machine Learning** at [Amar iSchool](https://amarischool.com/), an online educational platform where we empower the local ML enthusiasts with a limited background knowledge of Computer Science and Mathematics. I used to work as a **Lead Machine Learning Engineer** at *[Omdena Inc.](https://omdena.com/)* and *[Pioneer Alpha Ltd.](https://pioneeralpha.com/)*. <br/> <br/>
My current research interests revolve around **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**, **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**, **Clinical NLP**, **Text Style Transfer (TST)**, **Explainable AI (XAI)**, **NLP Applications** and **Multimodal and Multidisciplinary Applications of AI**. I enjoy working with less explored ML topics like **Active Learning**, **Lifelong Learning** and **Data-Centric AI**. However, I should concede that sometimes while solving a particular research problem, I explore different approaches (especially the unconventional ones) which are not directly aligned to my research interests. I find this sort of explorations a learning opportunity and also a way to bring in different perspectives to solve problems more efficiently. I got habituated to this sort of problem solving approach during my my 4 years of competitive programming career (2017-2020).<br/> <br/>
Other than AI, I also like to explore History, Theology, Geopolitics, Psychology, Social Sciences and various STEM, medicine and healthcare-related topics in my leisure. As I consider myself a lifelong student of scientific research and development, I put myself on a ceaseless journey to unravel the mysteries of this convoluted universe so that I can bring positive changes to the world.
